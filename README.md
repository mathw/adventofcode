# Advent of Code
My Advent of Code solutions, in varying levels of mess.

This all started with Advent of Code 2016. I might go back and do 2015 at some point, and I'm really hoping there's a 2017 so I can add it!

2016's solutions are (intended to be) all in Rust. See the readme in the 2016 directory for more information.
